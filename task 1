# 1. Create a variable named pi and store 22/7
pi = 22/7

# Check data type of pi
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))


# 2. Create a variable called 'for' and assign value 4
# This will cause an error because 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python

# Uncomment below line to see the error
# for = 4

# Explanation:
print("\nWe cannot use 'for' as a variable name because it is a reserved keyword used for loops.")


# 3. Calculate Simple Interest
P = 10000      # Principal amount
R = 5          # Rate of interest
T = 3          # Time in years

SI = (P * R * T) / 100

print("\nPrincipal:", P)
print("Rate:", R)
print("Time:", T)
print("Simple Interest for 3 years:", SI)
